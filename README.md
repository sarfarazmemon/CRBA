# CRBA
Introduces the Composite Recurrent Bi-Attention (CRBA) model, designed for anomaly detection in video surveillance. The  CRBA model integrates DenseNet201 for extracting the spatial features and BiLSTM for capturing temporal dependencies in video sequences. Including a multi-attention layer enables the model to focus on crucial spatiotemporal regions, enhancing its ability to differ-entiate between normal and abnormal behaviors.
